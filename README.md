## Library Management System
develop a fully functional Web API for a Library Management System using Laravel. This API will manage books, authors, and users of the library, incorporating complex relationships and functionalities.


## Testing the system 
In terminal 
first, you have to git clone https://github.com/MayaSker2/task7.git


after getting a clone from this repo you should follow this steps in terminal


cd <project folder-name>
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

\\\\\\\\\\\\

 you should create database then  do this 

php artisan migrate
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
finally
 run the project 

php artisan serve
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

now you can use this documentation (that i made it by Postman) to test the apis
```bash
